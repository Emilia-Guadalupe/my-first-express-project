# How do you see this project? 

It's easy: 

First, you have to install the Express Generator, with command 'npx express-generator the-name-of-your-project'

Then, once you have that installed, you have to install some dependencies, with command 'npm install'. 

You can see all the steps to getting started here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

If you have all that, then you're ready to see both lists of elements typing: 

-localhost:3000/users
-localhost:3000/users/quantity

(The names on the list are fictional users, not real people).
